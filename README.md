# Tetris

A recreation of modern Tetris. 

I started this assignment during the summer in 2022 as a side project and now I have started working on this project again. I decided that it would be beneficial to have my personal interests/exercises be available here to be tracked, observed, and backed up.

Trying to figure things out one part at a time.
